# Recommendation system using semantic search

This repo contains just a reference to a public notebook on Kaggle with a short code for a simple, but quite efficient restaurant recommendation system that makes use of `Sentence Transformers` pretrained language model for semantic search. 

You can find it under [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/code/juptra/bangalore-restaurants).
